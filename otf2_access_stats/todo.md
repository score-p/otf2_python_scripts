- Use standard attributes for libc - malloc and co.
- Start and end timestamp for flush
- Think about graphical representation:
    - Resource utilization (variance)
    - Summary table(per file):
        - Time spent in flush
        - Flushed data
        - Flush coverage
        - Allocated Memory
        - Number of allocations
        - *Time spent in transfers
    - Allocation size chart: show different allocation size and how times they occured
    - Visualize the portion that are flushed of a file
    - Access pattern chart: visualize accesses dependent on the time(chrome tracing)
    - Source code chart: assign the sampled accesses to loc
- Argument for trace output
- Are overlapped spaces possible?
- AddressSpace -> Allocation
- Introduce process parallelism
- Put flask into electron
